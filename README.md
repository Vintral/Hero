# Hero's Quest

Stand alone game designed to be similar to Choose Your Own Adventure books with some RPG aspects involved.  Heavily influenced as a concept by the Lone Wolf series of books.

End goal is to create a series of adventures with more unrestricted movement through sections, and some randomness involved not just in combat but in story layout.  Possibly looking to incorporate some elements of AI to achieve this and smooth things over.
